# Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability
This is a repository containing my third assignment for MSCS532. This is a Python implementation of Randomized Quicksort, Deterministic Quicksort, and Hashing with Chaining.

## Project Overview
This assignment was designed to show understanding of how algorithms perform under different conditions. It included an analysis of the efficiency and scalibility of Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining. The project aimed to show the development of skills necessary to provide an evaluation of algoritm performence, efficiency in practical implementation, and a showcase of how to make informed decisions on algorithm selection based on theoretical and empirical analysis.

### Part 1: Quicksort Analysis
This part of the implementation focused on the implementation of the Randomized Quicksort algorithm and provided an empirical comparsion against the Deterministic Quicksort algorithm.

### Part 2: Hashing with Chaining
This part of the implementation focused on the implementation of a hash table using chaining for collison resolution.

### Project Deliverables:
```RandomizedQuicksort.py``` : Python file containing implementation of Randomized Quicksort with various edge and use cases such as repeared elements, empty arrays, and already sorted arrays.

```DeterministicQuicksort.py``` : Python file containing implementation of Deterministic Quicksort using the first element of an array. The script contains the comparsion logic and prints running times for both the deterministic and randomized Quicksort.

```HashingwChaining.py``` : Python file containing a hash table using chaining for collision resolution and some use cases.

```Analysis Report``` : [TBA] Pending Report containing analysis of average case time complexity for Randomized Quicksort and analysis of how load factor affects performance of search, insert, delete within a hash table as well as strategies for maintaining a low load factor.
